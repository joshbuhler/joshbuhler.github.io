      <description>Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr.</description>

      <description>Find out what makes you kinder, what opens you up and brings out the most loving, generous, and unafraid version of you — and go after those things as if nothing else matters.
Because, actually, nothing else does.

      <description>The Pinewood Derby was always one of my favorite things about being a cub scout. Even when I moved on to boy scouts, it was always a bit of a bummer that we didn&#39;t get to participate anymore.
Fast forward a few years, and I&#39;m now the Webelos den leader of our pack. And that means… Pinewood Derby! While Drew isn&#39;t quite old enough to officially join the pack yet, for all intents and purposes, we consider him an honorary member of our den, as he attends every meeting faithfully with me.</description>
