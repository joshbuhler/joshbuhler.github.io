      <description>The more I use ham radio, the more I start to fine-tune and tweak my setup. Especially when it comes to the presets on the radio in my truck. I’ve spent a lot of time collecting the info and programming it into my radio, and I’d hate to lose that.
Mostly because I&#39;m a giant nerd, I eventually created a Git repository to store the backups of my preset info, and have hosted it on Github.</description>

      <description>Clearly I&#39;m terrible at posting on a regular basis, as it&#39;s been over a year since my last post. But once again, I recently had the opportunity to help with communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run.
This year was very similar to last year, but we still had a lot of fun. I also got a chance to flex my ham nerd muscles a bit more, as this year I provided the packet system we&#39;d be using for the event.</description>

      <description>This weekend I had the opportunity to help out with some communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run. Just like the name says, it’s a 100 mile race, and the course has folks running from East Mountain Wilderness Park near Kaysville, UT down to Soldier Hollow in Wasatch Mountain State Park. Some friends of mine have been volunteering for this event for a few years now, and have asked me if I was interested in the past, but I haven’t been able to help until this year.</description>
