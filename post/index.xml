      <description>One of my favorite things about living in Utah is how easy it can be to get out of the city, and get outdoorsy. Last week was one of those days where Drew and I got to take advantage of that proximity to nature. With the kids back in school, Cindy took advantage of her new found freedom to head up American Fork Canyon to do some paddleboarding on Tibble Fork.</description>

      <description>The more I use ham radio, the more I start to fine-tune and tweak my setup. Especially when it comes to the presets on the radio in my truck. I’ve spent a lot of time collecting the info and programming it into my radio, and I’d hate to lose that.
Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m a giant nerd, I eventually created a Git repository to store the backups of my preset info, and have hosted it on Github.</description>

      <description>When we first moved into our house, the home builder installed a set of Chamberlain myQ enabled smart garage door openers. I was excited about the possibility of being able to use my phone to make sure that our doors were closed when we were away, or to be notified if they opened when they shouldn&amp;rsquo;t.</description>

      <description>This year&amp;rsquo;s annual camping adventure with my dad and brothers, took us down to Moab, Utah for a few days of riding and exploring on our ATVs. This was a trip that we had been looking forward to for some time, and when the morning or departure arrived, we met at Dad&amp;rsquo;s house to load up the trucks and get going.</description>

      <description>With spring on the way, the family was looking forward to our first big trip of the year, especially with our new camp trailer. While we really liked our popup trailer, we had just outgrown it a lot faster than we thought we would, and could use just a little more space.</description>

      <description>If you go off-road often, it&amp;rsquo;s not a matter of if, but when you&amp;rsquo;re going to need an air compressor, or some other source of compressed air. Whether it&amp;rsquo;s for airing your tires back up before returning to pavement, or refilling a repaired tire, having a compressor with you is vital.</description>

      <title>Science and Spirituality</title>

      <description>Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr.</description>

      <description>Find out what makes you kinder, what opens you up and brings out the most loving, generous, and unafraid version of you — and go after those things as if nothing else matters.
Because, actually, nothing else does.

      <description>Earlier this month, I was able to attend the first annual Expedition Utah Overland Skills Camp, which my wife and I began to affectionately refer to as “big boy scout camp”. No merit badges, but lots of time spent out camping with a bunch of guys off learning new skills.</description>

      <description>The Pinewood Derby was always one of my favorite things about being a cub scout. Even when I moved on to boy scouts, it was always a bit of a bummer that we didn&amp;rsquo;t get to participate anymore.
Fast forward a few years, and I&amp;rsquo;m now the Webelos den leader of our pack.</description>

      <description>Clearly I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at posting on a regular basis, as it&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since my last post. But once again, I recently had the opportunity to help with communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run.
This year was very similar to last year, but we still had a lot of fun.</description>

      <description>This weekend I had the opportunity to help out with some communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run. Just like the name says, it’s a 100 mile race, and the course has folks running from East Mountain Wilderness Park near Kaysville, UT down to Soldier Hollow in Wasatch Mountain State Park.</description>

      <title>Capitol Reef - Are we there yet?</title>

      <description>So far our plan to head south to escape the cold of Salt Lake wasn&amp;rsquo;t working so well. While it was a bit warmer during the day down in the Capitol Reef area, the nights were still a bit chilly. Still, it was better than the 2-3 inches of snow we had left behind back home.</description>

      <title>Hiking Capitol Reef</title>

      <description>Heading to Capitol Reef for spring break wasn&amp;rsquo;t part of the plan. Originally, we had planned on going down to Zion National Park. However, our failure to plan ahead meant that getting a campsite for the weekend was fairly unlikely. So we adjusted our plans. Instead, we&amp;rsquo;d head down to Arches, and spend some time exploring Moab as well.</description>

      <description>This last weekend, a couple of friends and I took a trip along the Utah portion of the Transcontinental Railroad route. We planned to do a bit of sightseeing, as well as check out a few different bits of artwork along the way. I had been looking forward to this trip, as I’ve wanted to run this route for a while, but just hadn’t made it out there yet.</description>

      <description>Fall break this year has been a bit of a staycation for us. Sleeping in, working on projects around the house, and just hanging out. One day, we took the Bronco for a drive up to the Uintas, just cruising up the Mirror Lake Highway.</description>

      <description>Last weekend RME4x4.com hosted a training day down in the Little Moab area. I’ve never been down there, and I’m almost always up for a quick trip to learn something new.
We met up at the Chevron in Saratoga Springs, and once the group was assembled, we made the trek down to Cedar Valley.</description>

      <description>“Well, they’re either out here lost too, or they’re out to murder us. Both seem likely right now.”
Luckily, the folks following us around the trails west of Milford, UT weren’t out to murder us that night, and as a result, I’m still here to tell this story.</description>
