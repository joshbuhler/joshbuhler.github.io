      <description>The Pinewood Derby was always one of my favorite things about being a cub scout. Even when I moved on to boy scouts, it was always a bit of a bummer that we didn&#39;t get to participate anymore.
Fast forward a few years, and I&#39;m now the Webelos den leader of our pack. And that means… Pinewood Derby! While Drew isn&#39;t quite old enough to officially join the pack yet, for all intents and purposes, we consider him an honorary member of our den, as he attends every meeting faithfully with me.</description>
