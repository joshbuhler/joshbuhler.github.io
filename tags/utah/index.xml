      <description>With spring on the way, the family was looking forward to our first big trip of the year, especially with our new camp trailer. While we really liked our popup trailer, we had just outgrown it a lot faster than we thought we would, and could use just a little more space. So earlier this year we traded in the popup for something a little bit bigger.
For the trailer’s maiden voyage, we decided to head down to Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument.</description>

      <title>Science and Spirituality</title>
      <link>https://josh.buhler.me/post/science-spirituality/</link>

      <description>Science is not only compatible with spirituality; it is a profound source of spirituality. When we recognize our place in an immensity of light-years and in the passage of ages, when we grasp the intricacy, beauty, and subtlety of life, then that soaring feeling, that sense of elation and humility combined, is surely spiritual. So are our emotions in the the presence of great art or music or literature, or of acts of exemplary selfless courage such as those of Mohandas Gandhi or Martin Luther King, Jr.</description>

      <title>Welcome to Big Boy Scout Camp</title>

      <description>Earlier this month, I was able to attend the first annual Expedition Utah Overland Skills Camp, which my wife and I began to affectionately refer to as “big boy scout camp”. No merit badges, but lots of time spent out camping with a bunch of guys off learning new skills.
The event began for me by waking up Friday morning at 6:00AM so that I could arrive in Price, UT by 9:00AM for a trail ride to the event site.</description>

      <title>Another 100 Miles of Heaven and Hell</title>

      <description>Clearly I&#39;m terrible at posting on a regular basis, as it&#39;s been over a year since my last post. But once again, I recently had the opportunity to help with communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run.
This year was very similar to last year, but we still had a lot of fun. I also got a chance to flex my ham nerd muscles a bit more, as this year I provided the packet system we&#39;d be using for the event.</description>

      <description>This weekend I had the opportunity to help out with some communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run. Just like the name says, it’s a 100 mile race, and the course has folks running from East Mountain Wilderness Park near Kaysville, UT down to Soldier Hollow in Wasatch Mountain State Park. Some friends of mine have been volunteering for this event for a few years now, and have asked me if I was interested in the past, but I haven’t been able to help until this year.</description>

      <title>Capitol Reef - Are we there yet?</title>
      <link>https://josh.buhler.me/post/capitol-reef-are-we-there-yet/</link>

      <description>So far our plan to head south to escape the cold of Salt Lake wasn&#39;t working so well. While it was a bit warmer during the day down in the Capitol Reef area, the nights were still a bit chilly. Still, it was better than the 2-3 inches of snow we had left behind back home.
    Due to the chilly nights and running the heater in the trailer, we blew through a full tank of propane in just two nights.</description>

      <title>Hiking Capitol Reef</title>

      <description>Heading to Capitol Reef for spring break wasn&#39;t part of the plan. Originally, we had planned on going down to Zion National Park. However, our failure to plan ahead meant that getting a campsite for the weekend was fairly unlikely. So we adjusted our plans. Instead, we&#39;d head down to Arches, and spend some time exploring Moab as well. Not really thinking that one through much either, we soon realized that Easter Jeep Safari was happening that same weekend, so we&#39;d again have to adjust our plans.</description>

      <description>This last weekend, a couple of friends and I took a trip along the Utah portion of the Transcontinental Railroad route. We planned to do a bit of sightseeing, as well as check out a few different bits of artwork along the way. I had been looking forward to this trip, as I’ve wanted to run this route for a while, but just hadn’t made it out there yet.</description>

      <description>Fall break this year has been a bit of a staycation for us. Sleeping in, working on projects around the house, and just hanging out. One day, we took the Bronco for a drive up to the Uintas, just cruising up the Mirror Lake Highway.
    After getting a late start, we made our way up Parley&#39;s Canyon, grabbed a quick lunch in Park City, then continued on to Kamas.</description>

      <title>Little Moab Training Day</title>

      <description>Last weekend RME4x4.com hosted a training day down in the Little Moab area. I’ve never been down there, and I’m almost always up for a quick trip to learn something new.
We met up at the Chevron in Saratoga Springs, and once the group was assembled, we made the trek down to Cedar Valley. The night was spent camped out next to Chimney Rock, and a group of Boy Scouts (that wasn&#39;t planned).</description>

      <title>Ghost Town Tour 2016</title>

      <description>“Well, they’re either out here lost too, or they’re out to murder us. Both seem likely right now.”
Luckily, the folks following us around the trails west of Milford, UT weren’t out to murder us that night, and as a result, I’m still here to tell this story.
When the trip reports from the 2015 Ghost Town Tour were posted to ExpeditionUtah.com, I was fairly jealous about having missed the trip.</description>
