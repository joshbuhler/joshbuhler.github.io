      <description>The more I use ham radio, the more I start to fine-tune and tweak my setup. Especially when it comes to the presets on the radio in my truck. I’ve spent a lot of time collecting the info and programming it into my radio, and I’d hate to lose that.
Mostly because I&amp;rsquo;m a giant nerd, I eventually created a Git repository to store the backups of my preset info, and have hosted it on Github.</description>

      <description>Clearly I&amp;rsquo;m terrible at posting on a regular basis, as it&amp;rsquo;s been over a year since my last post. But once again, I recently had the opportunity to help with communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run.
This year was very similar to last year, but we still had a lot of fun.</description>

      <description>This weekend I had the opportunity to help out with some communications for the Wasatch Front 100 Mile Endurance Run. Just like the name says, it’s a 100 mile race, and the course has folks running from East Mountain Wilderness Park near Kaysville, UT down to Soldier Hollow in Wasatch Mountain State Park.</description>
